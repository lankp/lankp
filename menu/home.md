I am a PhD candidate in pure mathematics at the University of South Carolina under the supervision of [Dr. Matthew Ballard](https://www.matthewrobertballard.com), and a member of the [SCAGNT research group](https://www.scagnt.org/seminar/). Previously, I was a M.Sc. student at the University of New Mexico and was advised by [Dr. Alexandru Buium](http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium). My CV may be found [here](https://lankp.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).

My work falls into both landscapes of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra where I utilize the machinery of derived categories to understand problems lying within these two subject matters. This direction of research has interactions with singularity theory, and in essence the objective is to understand the behavior through homological methods coming from derived categories. Broadly speaking, I am interested in problems regarding the applications of derived categories in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. For more details, see [here](https://lankp.github.io/research).

This upcoming year I will be organizing an AMS Special Session on Derived Categories, Arithmetic, and Geometry at the JMM in 2024, see [here](https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2024/2300_program_ss105.html#title). Previous things I have helped organize can be found [here](https://lankp.github.io/organization)
